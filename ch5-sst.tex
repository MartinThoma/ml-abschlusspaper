\section{SST}\label{sec:SST}
\Gls{SST} is a Python package hosted on \gls{PyPI} and developed on GitHub. It
makes use of Lasagne (see \cref{sec:frameworks}).

It can be installed via \verb+pip install sst+. To make the installation as
simple as possible, this does not install all requirements.
\verb+sst selfcheck+ gives the user the possibility to check which packages
are still required and manually install them.
