Segment street on a pixel basis from photographs taken from a drivers
perspective is important for self-driving cars and can also support other
object recognition tasks. A framework called SST was developed to examine
different neural networks accuracy and execution time. The best neural network
achieved an $F_1$-score of \SI{89.5}{\percent} with a simple feed forward
neural network which trained to solve a regression task.
