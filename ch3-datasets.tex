\section{Datasets}\label{sec:datasets}
The KITTI Road Estimation dataset \cite{Fritsch2013} was used for training of
the models and for obtaining the experimental results reported in
\cref{sec:evaluation}.

The left color image base kit contains a training and a test set. All photos
are in an urban environment. The training set has 95~photos with land markings
(um), 96~photos with multiple lane markings (umm) and 98~photos where the
street has no lane markings (uu). The test set has 96~um~photos, 94~umm~photos
and 100~uu~photos.

The width of all photos is in $\Set{1226, 1238, 1241, 1242}$, the height is in
$\Set{370, 374, 375, 376}$.

The data photos are given as 8-bit color RGB PNG files. The labels (ground
truth) are given as images of the same size as the data image, but with only
three colors: red (\verb+#ff0000+), magenta (\verb+#ff00ff+) for street and
black (\verb+#000000+) for other streets than the one the car is on.
