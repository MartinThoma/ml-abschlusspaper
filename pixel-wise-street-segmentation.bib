  Abstract                 = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPy’s syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5× faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-range detection of road surface in a sequence of images from a front camera aboard a vehicle is known as an unsolved problem. We propose an algorithm using a single camera and based on color segmentation which has interesting performance and which is stable along the sequence whatever its length. It is an off-line algorithm which makes good use of current and successive images to build reliable models of the color aspects of the road and of its environment at each vehicle position. To apply the proposed algorithm a radiometric calibration step is required to ensure uniform responses of the pixels over the image. The algorithm consists in three steps: image smoothing consistent with perspective effect on the road, building of the models of the road and non-road colors, and region growing of the road region. The relevance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by an application to the roadway visibility estimation in stereovision and its performance are illustrated by experiments in difficult situations.},

abstract={This paper presents a robust stereo-vision-based drivable road detection and tracking system that was designed to navigate an intelligent vehicle through challenging traffic scenarios and increment road safety in such scenarios with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). This system is based on a formulation of stereo with homography as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem in a Markov random held (MRF). Under this formulation, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm that alternates between computing the binary labeling for road/nonroad classification and learning the optimal parameters from the current input stereo pair itself. Furthermore, online extrinsic camera parameter reestimation and automatic MRF parameter tuning are performed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the proposed system. In the experiments, the system was tested on our experimental intelligent vehicles under various real challenging scenarios. The results have substantiated the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed system with respect to various challenging road scenarios such as heterogeneous road materials/textures, heavy shadows, changing illumination and weather conditions, and dynamic vehicle movements.},
