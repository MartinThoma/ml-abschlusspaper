\section{Frameworks}\label{sec:frameworks}
nolearn was used in combination with Lasagne~\cite{sander_dieleman_2015_27878}
to train the models. Lasagne is based on Theano~\cite{Bergstra2010}. We also
used Caffe~\cite{Jia2014} for \glspl{CNN}, but skipped that approach as the
framework crashed very often for different training approaches without giving
meaningful error messages.

Theano is a Python library which allows symbolic computation of derivatives as
well as automatic generation of GPU code. This is used to calculate the weight
update function for arbitrary feed-forward networks. Lasagne makes using Theano
simpler by providing some basic layer types with their update function and
nolearn adds some syntactic sugar.
