\section{Introduction}
Pixel-wise segmentation of street is an important part of assisted and
autonomous driving~\cite{Tarel2009}. It can help to understand road scenes and
reduce the space to search for lane markings. Traditionally, road segmentation
is done with computer vision methods such as watershed
transformation~\cite{Beucher1990}. Recent advances in deep neural networks,
especially in computer vision, suggest that \glspl{CNN} might perform better
on road segmentation tasks then those traditional approaches.
